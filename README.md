This repository houses a movie website called "DapnyFilmFlicker," which leverages the API provided by The Movie Database (TMDB). 
The website is meticulously crafted using fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, highlighting a minimalistic 
yet effective approach to web development.

The website is structured with distinct sections, offering users a seamless navigation experience. The primary sections include:

•	Home: The landing page where users initiate their exploration of the website.

•	Movies: A dedicated section for users to browse and discover a plethora of movies. 
  This section is likely to feature various upcoming movies, trending, search bar button, and all available movies.
  
•	About Us: An informative section providing insights into the creators or contributors behind Daphnee FilmFlicker. 
  This area could include details about the website's purpose, vision, and the team responsible for its development.
  
•	Sign-Up Option: While the website offers a sign-up option, it is emphasized that signing up is not mandatory. 
  This feature might be present to enhance user engagement by providing personalized experiences or features to registered users.
  
•	Upcoming Movies: A dynamic section that showcases movies scheduled for release in the near future, providing users with a sneak peek into 
  the upcoming cinematic experiences.
  
•	Trending Movies: This section highlights movies that are currently trending, ensuring users are informed about the latest and most popular releases.

•	Available Movies: A curated collection of movies that are readily accessible on the platform. This section may include a diverse range of films for users
  to explore.

Additionally, users have the option to view the source code of the website, fostering transparency and openness about the development process. 
The repository is a testament to the use of foundational web technologies to create an engaging and functional movie-centric platform. 
Whether users are looking for information about movies, exploring trending content, or simply enjoying the available films, DapnyFilmFlicker
aims to provide a comprehensive and enjoyable experience without the necessity of signing up. 

It was created to explore the API and how does it work, also to provide a movie website using API.
